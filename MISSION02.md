# NetClaw 🦞

> *An AI agent that owns your network.*

NetClaw is a CCIE-level digital coworker built on OpenClaw. It connects to your real network infrastructure through MCP servers, runs Genie-parsed show commands, applies configuration changes safely, audits policy, reconciles your source of truth, and tracks every action in an immutable Git-based audit trail.

**Reach. Grab. Execute.**

## What NetClaw Is

NetClaw is not a chatbot that talks about networks. It is an agent that **operates** networks.

It holds CCIE R&S #AI-001. It has opinions about your OSPF area design. It will tell you your BGP path selection is wrong and explain the 11-step algorithm. It will not touch a device without a pre-change baseline and a ServiceNow Change Request. It will commit every action to GAIT so there is always an answer to "what did the AI do and why."

## Skills (18)

### pyATS Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `pyats-health-check` | 8-step health assessment with threshold-based severity ratings. Cross-references NetBox for expected vs actual interface state. Runs in parallel across all devices in scope via pCall. |
| `pyats-routing` | Deep analysis of OSPF, BGP (full 11-step path selection), EIGRP, IS-IS, and redistribution. |
| `pyats-security` | 9-step CIS-style audit: management plane, AAA, ACLs, CoPP, routing auth, SNMP, encryption. Integrates ISE and NVD CVE. Fleet-wide parallel execution via pCall. |
| `pyats-topology` | CDP/LLDP/ARP/routing peer discovery via pCall across all devices simultaneously. Reconciles against NetBox cables. Outputs Draw.io and Markmap. |
| `pyats-config-mgmt` | 5-phase change workflow. Auto-creates ServiceNow Change Request. GAIT commits at every phase. |
| `pyats-troubleshoot` | Symptom-based OSI layer-by-layer diagnosis. Uses pCall for rapid parallel state collection from all suspect hops. Checks NetBox source of truth during investigation. |
| `pyats-dynamic-test` | Generates and executes deterministic pyATS aetest scripts with embedded TEST_DATA. |
| `pyats-parallel-ops` | Governs multi-device operations at scale. pCall grouping by role/site, failure isolation, result aggregation, severity-sorted fleet reporting. |

### NetBox Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `netbox-reconcile` | Diffs NetBox intent vs device reality. Flags IP drift, undocumented links, missing interfaces. Opens ServiceNow incidents. |

### ACI Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `aci-fabric-audit` | Fabric health, policy audit (contracts, EPGs, BDs), fault analysis, endpoint learning verification. |
| `aci-change-deploy` | Safe ACI policy change workflow with ServiceNow gating, pre/post fault diff, GAIT audit. |

### ISE Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `ise-posture-audit` | Reviews authorization policies, posture compliance, profiling gaps, and TrustSec SGT matrix for over-permissiveness. |
| `ise-incident-response` | Rapid endpoint investigation and quarantine (human-authorized). Opens ServiceNow Security Incident. |

### ITSM Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `servicenow-change-workflow` | Full ITSM-gated change: CR creation → approval gate → execution → verification → closure. |

### Audit Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `gait-session-tracking` | Mandatory Git-based audit trail. Every session starts with branch creation, ends with audit log display. |

### Reference Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `wikipedia-research` | Protocol history, standards evolution, technology context for human teammates. |

## Standard Workflows

### Health Check
```
pyats-health-check
→ CPU/memory/interface/BGP/OSPF/log/environmental assessment
→ Cross-reference NetBox for expected interface states
→ Severity ratings: HEALTHY / WARNING / CRITICAL / UNKNOWN
→ GAIT audit trail
```

### Source of Truth Reconciliation
```
netbox-reconcile
→ NetBox intent pull (devices, interfaces, IPs, VLANs, cables)
→ pyATS actual state collection
→ Diff engine: IP_DRIFT / MISSING / UNDOCUMENTED / CABLE_MISMATCH
→ ServiceNow incident per CRITICAL discrepancy
→ Markmap drift summary
→ GAIT commit
```

### Configuration Change
```
servicenow-change-workflow + pyats-config-mgmt
→ Pre-check: no open P1/P2 on affected CIs
→ ServiceNow CR created, approved
→ pyats-config-mgmt: baseline → apply → verify
→ ServiceNow CR closed
→ GAIT full session audit
```

### ACI Policy Change
```
servicenow-change-workflow + aci-change-deploy
→ CR created with tenant/policy scope
→ Fabric baseline (faults, contract counters)
→ APIC change applied
→ Fault delta check
→ CR closed / escalated
→ GAIT full session audit
```

### Security Audit
```
pyats-security
→ Management plane, AAA, ACLs, CoPP, routing auth, SNMP, encryption
→ ISE: verify device registered as NAD
→ NVD CVE: software version vulnerability scan (CVSS ≥ 7.0)
→ Exposure correlation: CVE + running-config
→ GAIT commit
```

### Endpoint Incident Response
```
ise-incident-response
→ Endpoint lookup by MAC/IP/username
→ Auth history, posture, profile review
→ Human decision point
→ [If authorized] ISE quarantine
→ ServiceNow Security Incident
→ GAIT audit trail
```

### Vulnerability Audit
```
pyats-security (CVE module)
→ show version → NVD CVE search
→ CVSS scoring → exposure check vs running-config
→ Prioritized remediation: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM
→ GAIT commit
```

### Topology Discovery
```
pyats-topology
→ CDP/LLDP/ARP/routing peer collection
→ NetBox cable reconciliation (documented / undocumented / missing)
→ Draw.io diagram (color-coded by reconciliation status)
→ Markmap mind map
→ GAIT commit
```

## Safety Model

NetClaw enforces these non-negotiable constraints:

**Never guesses device state** — runs a show command or queries NetBox first, always.

**Never touches a device without a baseline** — pre-change state is captured and committed to GAIT before any config push.

**Never skips the Change Request** — ServiceNow CR must exist and be in `Approved` state before execution (except Emergency changes, which require immediate human notification).

**Never runs destructive commands** — `write erase`, `erase`, `reload`, `delete`, `format` are refused.

**Never auto-quarantines an endpoint** — ISE endpoint group modification always requires explicit human confirmation.

**Never writes to NetBox** — NetBox is read-only. Discrepancies are ticketed, not auto-corrected.

**Always verifies after changes** — if post-change verification fails, the Change Request is not closed and the human is notified.

**Always commits to GAIT** — every session ends with `gait_show` so the human can see the full audit trail.

---

## GAIT Audit Trail

Every NetClaw session produces an immutable Git-based record of:
- What was asked
- What data was collected (and from where)
- What was analyzed (and what conclusions were reached)
- What was changed (and on what device)
- What the verification result was
- What ServiceNow tickets were created or updated

This is not optional. It is how NetClaw earns trust in production environments.
