# Microsoft Graph — Visio Diagram Generation

Generate professional Visio (.vsdx) network topology diagrams from live device discovery data. Upload and manage them on SharePoint via Microsoft Graph API. This is the production documentation workflow — from CDP/LLDP discovery output to a Visio file that lives in your team's SharePoint.

## How to Call the Tools

The Microsoft Graph MCP server is invoked via npx with Azure AD credentials:

```bash
AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  python3 $MCP_CALL "npx -y @anthropic-ai/microsoft-graph-mcp" <tool-name> '<arguments-json>'
```

## Visio Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Discover the Network Topology

Use **pyats-topology** to collect CDP/LLDP neighbor data from all devices:

```bash
PYATS_TESTBED_PATH=$PYATS_TESTBED_PATH python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $PYATS_MCP_SCRIPT" pyats_run_show_command '{"device_name":"R1","command":"show cdp neighbors detail"}'
```

Collect from all devices via pCall for a complete topology view.

### Step 2: Build the Visio Diagram Content

From discovery data, construct the topology as a Visio-compatible format. Use the OOXML structure that Visio .vsdx files use (ZIP archive containing XML).

For simpler workflows, generate the topology as **Mermaid** first, then use **Draw.io** for the editable diagram, and export the final version as .vsdx via the Draw.io editor.

### Step 3: Upload to SharePoint

```bash
AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  python3 $MCP_CALL "npx -y @anthropic-ai/microsoft-graph-mcp" graph_upload_file '{"driveId":"<drive-id>","parentId":"<topology-folder-id>","fileName":"campus-topology-2026-02-22.vsdx","content":"<base64-vsdx-content>"}'
```

### Step 4: Share the Diagram

Create a sharing link for the team:

```bash
AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  python3 $MCP_CALL "npx -y @anthropic-ai/microsoft-graph-mcp" graph_create_sharing_link '{"driveId":"<drive-id>","itemId":"<file-id>","type":"view","scope":"organization"}'
```

## Diagram Types

### 1. Physical Topology Diagram

Generated from CDP/LLDP neighbor data. Shows:
- Device icons (router, switch, firewall, AP)
- Physical connections with interface labels
- IP addressing on each link
- Link speeds and media types

Data sources:
- `show cdp neighbors detail` — device names, platforms, interfaces, IPs
- `show lldp neighbors detail` — same for LLDP-enabled devices
- `show interfaces` — link speeds, media types, error counters

### 2. Logical Topology Diagram

Generated from routing protocol data. Shows:
- OSPF areas with area boundaries
- BGP AS topology with eBGP/iBGP peerings
- VRF boundaries and route leaking points
- VXLAN overlay vs underlay

Data sources:
- `show ip ospf neighbor` + `show ip ospf database` — OSPF topology
- `show bgp summary` — BGP peering topology
- `show vrf` — VRF membership

### 3. Reconciliation Status Diagram

Color-coded by NetBox reconciliation status:
- **Green** — Documented in NetBox, matches live state
- **Yellow** — Documented but mismatched (IP drift, MTU mismatch)
- **Red** — Undocumented link (exists on device, not in NetBox)
- **Gray** — Missing link (in NetBox, not seen on device)

Data source: **netbox-reconcile** skill output

### 4. Data Center Fabric Diagram

ACI-specific topology showing:
- Spine/leaf fabric with APIC controllers
- Tenant/VRF/BD/EPG hierarchy
- Contract relationships
- External connectivity (L3Out)

Data source: **aci-fabric-audit** skill output

## Integration with Other Skills

- **pyats-topology** — Primary data source for physical/logical topology discovery
- **netbox-reconcile** — Provides reconciliation status for color-coded diagrams
- **aci-fabric-audit** — ACI fabric topology data for data center diagrams
- **drawio-diagram** — Use Draw.io for quick interactive editing, then export to .vsdx format
- **msgraph-files** — Organize Visio files in SharePoint folder structure
- **msgraph-teams** — Post diagram links to Teams channels for team visibility
- **gait-session-tracking** — Record diagram generation in audit trail

## Naming Convention

## GAIT Audit Trail

Record diagram generation in GAIT:

```bash
python3 $MCP_CALL "python3 -u $GAIT_MCP_SCRIPT" gait_record_turn '{"input":{"role":"assistant","content":"Generated campus physical topology diagram from CDP/LLDP discovery (4 devices, 6 links). Uploaded to SharePoint Network Engineering/Topology/Physical/campus-physical-topology-2026-02-22.vsdx. Sharing link created for Network Engineering team.","artifacts":[]}}'
```
