# NetClaw

A CCIE-level AI network engineering coworker. Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) with Anthropic Claude, 32 skills, and 15 MCP server backends for complete network automation with ITSM gating, source-of-truth reconciliation, immutable audit trails, and Slack-native operations.

## What It Does

NetClaw is an autonomous network engineering agent powered by Claude Opus that can:

- **Monitor** device health — CPU, memory, interfaces, hardware, NTP, logs — fleet-wide in parallel
- **Troubleshoot** connectivity, routing adjacencies, performance, and flapping using OSI-layer methodology with multi-hop parallel state collection
- **Analyze** routing protocols — OSPF (LSDB, LSA types, area design), BGP (11-step path selection, NOTIFICATION codes), EIGRP (DUAL states)
- **Audit** security posture — ACLs, AAA, CoPP, management plane hardening, CIS benchmarks, ISE NAD verification, NVD CVE scanning
- **Discover** topology via CDP/LLDP, ARP, routing peers — reconcile against NetBox cables
- **Configure** devices with full ITSM-gated change management — ServiceNow CR, baseline, apply, verify, rollback
- **Reconcile** NetBox source of truth against live device state — flag IP drift, undocumented links, missing interfaces
- **Manage** ACI fabric — health audits, policy analysis, safe tenant/VRF/BD/EPG changes with fault delta rollback
- **Investigate** endpoints via ISE — auth history, posture, profiling, human-authorized quarantine
- **Scan** for CVE vulnerabilities against the NVD database with CVSS severity correlation and exposure confirmation
- **Manage** F5 BIG-IP load balancers — virtual servers, pools, iRules, stats, and change management
- **Operate** Catalyst Center — device inventory, client monitoring, site management, and troubleshooting
- **Calculate** IPv4 and IPv6 subnets — VLSM planning, wildcard masks, allocation standards
- **Alert** via Slack — severity-formatted notifications, incident workflows, and user-aware routing
- **Diagram** your network with Draw.io topology maps (color-coded by reconciliation status)
- **Visualize** protocol hierarchies as interactive Markmap mind maps
- **Reference** IETF RFCs and Wikipedia for standards-compliant configuration
- **Audit** every action in an immutable Git-based trail (GAIT) — there is always an answer to "what did the AI do and why"

## How Skills Work

NetClaw uses **OpenClaw Skills** — not `mcpServers` config — to give the agent its capabilities. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file that teaches the agent how to call a specific tool via shell exec.

```
User asks question via Slack/WebChat
       |
       v
OpenClaw loads all 32 SKILL.md files into agent context
       |
       v
Agent picks the right skill(s), constructs MCP call via mcp-call.py
       |
       v
python3 mcp-call.py "<server-command>" <tool-name> '<arguments-json>'
       |
       v
MCP server processes request, returns structured response
       |
       v
Agent analyzes result using CCIE-level expertise from skills
       |
       v
Records action in GAIT audit trail
       |
       v
Responds to user with findings, recommendations, or diagrams
```

Every tool call is a single shell command — no persistent server connections, no port management.

### Skill Anatomy

Each `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: pyats-health-check
description: "Comprehensive device health monitoring..."
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  { "openclaw": { "requires": { "bins": ["python3"], "env": ["PYATS_TESTBED_PATH"] } } }
---

# Device Health Check

(Step-by-step procedures, show command examples, threshold tables,
 report templates — everything the agent needs to work autonomously)
```

The `metadata.openclaw.requires` block declares binary and environment variable dependencies. The markdown body is the agent's playbook.

## Standard Workflows

### Health Check
```
pyats-health-check (+ pyats-parallel-ops for fleet)
--> CPU/memory/interface/BGP/OSPF/log/environmental assessment
--> Cross-reference NetBox for expected interface states
--> Severity ratings: HEALTHY / WARNING / CRITICAL / UNKNOWN
--> GAIT audit trail
```

### Source of Truth Reconciliation
```
netbox-reconcile
--> NetBox intent pull (devices, interfaces, IPs, VLANs, cables)
--> pyATS actual state collection (pCall across fleet)
--> Diff engine: IP_DRIFT / MISSING / UNDOCUMENTED / CABLE_MISMATCH
--> ServiceNow incident per CRITICAL discrepancy
--> Markmap drift summary
--> GAIT commit
```

### Configuration Change
```
servicenow-change-workflow + pyats-config-mgmt
--> Pre-check: no open P1/P2 on affected CIs
--> ServiceNow CR created, approved
--> pyats-config-mgmt: baseline --> apply --> verify
--> ServiceNow CR closed
--> GAIT full session audit
```

### ACI Policy Change
```
servicenow-change-workflow + aci-change-deploy
--> CR created with tenant/policy scope
--> Fabric baseline (faults, contract counters)
--> APIC change applied (dependency order)
--> Fault delta check
--> CR closed / escalated
--> GAIT full session audit
```

### Security Audit
```
pyats-security
--> Management plane, AAA, ACLs, CoPP, routing auth, SNMP, encryption
--> ISE: verify device registered as NAD
--> NVD CVE: software version vulnerability scan (CVSS >= 7.0)
--> Exposure correlation: CVE + running-config
--> GAIT commit
```

### Endpoint Incident Response
```
ise-incident-response
--> Endpoint lookup by MAC/IP/username
--> Auth history, posture, profile review
--> Human decision point
--> [If authorized] ISE quarantine
--> ServiceNow Security Incident
--> GAIT audit trail
```

### Topology Discovery
```
pyats-topology
--> CDP/LLDP/ARP/routing peer collection (pCall across fleet)
--> NetBox cable reconciliation (documented / undocumented / missing)
--> Draw.io diagram (color-coded by reconciliation status)
--> Markmap mind map
--> GAIT commit
```

### What Goes Where

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent system prompt. Defines personality, rules, and workflow orchestration |
| `workspace/skills/` | Skill source files. `install.sh` copies these to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` |
| `testbed/testbed.yaml` | pyATS device inventory. Referenced by `PYATS_TESTBED_PATH` env var |
| `config/openclaw.json` | Model config template. Sets primary/fallback model only — no MCP config |
| `mcp-servers/` | Tool backends cloned by `install.sh`. Gitignored — rebuilt on install |
| `scripts/mcp-call.py` | Handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate |
| `scripts/gait-stdio.py` | Wraps GAIT MCP server for stdio mode (default is SSE) |

## What install.sh Does

1. **Checks prerequisites** — Node.js >= 18, Python 3, pip3, git, npx
2. **Installs OpenClaw** — `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
3. **Clones pyATS MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Clones Markmap MCP** — `git clone` + `npm install` + `npm run build`
5. **Clones GAIT MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install gait-ai fastmcp`
6. **Clones NetBox MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
7. **Clones ServiceNow MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
8. **Clones ACI MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
9. **Clones ISE MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
10. **Clones Wikipedia MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
11. **Caches npx packages** — `npm cache add` for Draw.io and RFC servers
12. **Clones NVD CVE MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install -e .`
13. **Clones Subnet Calculator MCP** — `git clone` (enhanced with IPv6 support)
14. **Clones F5 BIG-IP MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
15. **Clones Catalyst Center MCP** — `git clone` + `pip3 install` dependencies
16. **Deploys all 32 skills** — Copies `workspace/skills/*` to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`
17. **Sets environment** — Writes 14 env vars to `~/.openclaw/.env` (testbed path, all MCP script paths)
18. **Verifies installation** — Checks 14 critical files exist (all MCP server scripts + core scripts)
19. **Prints summary** — Lists all 15 MCP servers by category and all 32 skills by domain

## Testbed Configuration

Edit `testbed/testbed.yaml` to define your network devices:

```yaml
devices:
  R1:
    alias: "Core Router"
    type: router
    os: iosxe
    platform: CSR1kv
    credentials:
      default:
        username: admin
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}"
    connections:
      cli:
        protocol: ssh
        ip: your-device-hostname-or-ip
        port: 22
```

The `%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}` syntax pulls credentials from environment variables so they stay out of version control.

## Safety

NetClaw enforces non-negotiable constraints at every layer:

**Never guesses device state** — runs a show command or queries NetBox first, always.

**Never touches a device without a baseline** — pre-change state is captured and committed to GAIT before any config push.

**Never skips the Change Request** — ServiceNow CR must exist and be in `Approved` state before execution (except Emergency changes, which require immediate human notification).

**Never runs destructive commands** — `write erase`, `erase`, `reload`, `delete`, `format` are refused at the MCP server level.

**Never auto-quarantines an endpoint** — ISE endpoint group modification always requires explicit human confirmation.

**Never writes to NetBox** — NetBox is read-only. Discrepancies are ticketed in ServiceNow, not auto-corrected.

**Always verifies after changes** — if post-change verification fails, the CR is not closed and the human is notified.

**Always commits to GAIT** — every session ends with `gait_log` so the human can see the full audit trail.

## GAIT Audit Trail

Every NetClaw session produces an immutable Git-based record of:
- What was asked
- What data was collected (and from where)
- What was analyzed (and what conclusions were reached)
- What was changed (and on what device)
- What the verification result was
- What ServiceNow tickets were created or updated

This is not optional. It is how NetClaw earns trust in production environments.

## Example Conversations

Ask NetClaw anything you'd ask a senior network engineer:

```
"Run a health check on all devices"
--> pyats-health-check + pyats-parallel-ops: fleet-wide assessment, severity-sorted report

"Reconcile NetBox against the live network"
--> netbox-reconcile: drift detection, ServiceNow incidents for CRITICAL findings

"Is R1 vulnerable to any known CVEs?"
--> pyats-network (show version) + nvd-cve (search by IOS-XE version + CVSS scoring)

"Add a Loopback99 interface with IP 99.99.99.99/32"
--> servicenow-change-workflow (CR) + pyats-config-mgmt (baseline/apply/verify) + GAIT

"BGP peer 10.1.1.2 is down, help me fix it"
--> pyats-troubleshoot: parallel state from both peers, 9-item BGP checklist

"Audit the ACI fabric health"
--> aci-fabric-audit: nodes, policies, faults, endpoint learning

"Investigate endpoint 00:11:22:33:44:55"
--> ise-incident-response: auth history, posture, profile --> human decision point

"Show me the OSPF topology as a mind map"
--> pyats-routing (OSPF neighbors/database) + markmap-viz (generate mind map)

"Check the F5 load balancer health"
--> f5-health-check: virtual server stats, pool member status, active connections

"What clients are connected to Site-A?"
--> catc-client-ops: client list filtered by site, SSID, band, health scores

"Calculate a /22 for the 10.50.0.0 network"
--> subnet-calculator: VLSM breakdown, usable hosts, wildcard mask, CIDR notation

"What does RFC 4271 say about BGP hold timers?"
--> rfc-lookup: fetch RFC 4271, extract relevant section
```

See `examples/` for detailed workflow walkthroughs.
