## Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automateyournetwork/netclaw.git
cd netclaw
./scripts/install.sh          # installs everything, then launches the setup wizard
```

That's it. The installer clones 32 MCP servers, deploys 78 skills, then launches a two-phase setup:

**Phase 1: `openclaw onboard`** (OpenClaw's built-in wizard)
- Pick your AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex, 30+ options)
- Set up the gateway (local mode, auth, port)
- Connect channels (Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Install the daemon service

**Phase 2: `./scripts/setup.sh`** (NetClaw platform credentials)
- Network devices (testbed.yaml editor)
- Platform credentials (NetBox, Nautobot, Infrahub, Itential, ServiceNow, ACI, ISE, F5, Catalyst Center, NVD, Microsoft Graph, GitHub, CML, NSO, Meraki, FMC, ThousandEyes, RADKit, ContainerLab, AWS, GCP)
- Your identity (name, role, timezone for USER.md)

After setup, start NetClaw:

```bash
openclaw gateway              # terminal 1
openclaw chat --new           # terminal 2
```

Reconfigure anytime:
- `openclaw configure` — AI provider, gateway, channels
- `./scripts/setup.sh` — network platform credentials

## What It Does

NetClaw is an autonomous network engineering agent powered by Claude that can:

- **Monitor** device health — CPU, memory, interfaces, hardware, NTP, logs — fleet-wide in parallel
- **Troubleshoot** connectivity, routing adjacencies, performance, and flapping using OSI-layer methodology with multi-hop parallel state collection
- **Analyze** routing protocols — OSPF (LSDB, LSA types, area design), BGP (11-step path selection, NOTIFICATION codes), EIGRP (DUAL states)
- **Audit** security posture — ACLs, AAA, CoPP, management plane hardening, CIS benchmarks, ISE NAD verification, NVD CVE scanning
- **Discover** topology via CDP/LLDP, ARP, routing peers — reconcile against NetBox cables
- **Configure** devices with full ITSM-gated change management — ServiceNow CR, baseline, apply, verify, rollback
- **Reconcile** NetBox or Nautobot source of truth against live device state — flag IP drift, undocumented links, missing interfaces; query Nautobot IPAM for IP addresses, prefixes, VRF/tenant/site filtering when the org uses Nautobot instead of NetBox
- **Manage** ACI fabric — health audits, policy analysis, safe tenant/VRF/BD/EPG changes with fault delta rollback
- **Investigate** endpoints via ISE — auth history, posture, profiling, human-authorized quarantine
- **Audit** Cisco Secure Firewall policies via FMC — search access rules by IP/FQDN, resolve FTD device policies, cross-FMC consistency checks, and SGT-based policy review
- **Manage** Cisco Meraki infrastructure via Dashboard API (~804 endpoints) — org inventory, networks, devices, wireless SSIDs, RF profiles, switch ports, VLANs, MX firewall rules, site-to-site VPN, content filtering, security events, camera analytics, live diagnostics (ping, cable test), and configuration change audit
- **Monitor** network paths via Cisco ThousandEyes — synthetic test results, agent health, hop-by-hop path visualization (latency, loss, MPLS labels per hop), BGP route analysis (AS path, reachability, origin validation), outage investigation, anomaly detection, instant on-demand tests, endpoint VPN diagnostics, and AI-powered views explanations — via both community (9 tools, local stdio) and official (~20 tools, remote HTTP) MCP servers
- **Access** remote devices via Cisco RADKit cloud relay — discover device inventory, inspect device attributes and capabilities, execute CLI commands with timeout/truncation controls, and perform SNMP GET operations on air-gapped or cloud-unreachable devices without direct SSH/SNMP connectivity
- **Automate** Juniper JunOS devices via PyEZ/NETCONF — CLI command execution, configuration management, Jinja2 template rendering, device facts collection, and batch operations across router fleets
- **Monitor** Arista fabric via CloudVision Portal REST API — device inventory, event stream, connectivity monitor status, and device tag management for fleet-wide health assessment
- **Participate** in BGP and OSPF as a live routing peer — inject/withdraw routes, query RIB/LSDB, adjust LOCAL_PREF and OSPF cost, peer with real routers over GRE tunnels via native protocol speakers (RFC 4271/5340)
- **Scan** for CVE vulnerabilities against the NVD database with CVSS severity correlation and exposure confirmation
- **Manage** F5 BIG-IP load balancers — virtual servers, pools, iRules, stats, and change management
- **Audit** F5 BIG-IP via iControl REST API — LTM virtual servers, pools, nodes, 40+ monitor types, 60+ profile types, iRules, GTM wide IPs, system health (CPU, memory, disk), HA sync-status, certificates, analytics (HTTP, TCP, DNS, DoS), live-update signature freshness
- **Operate** Catalyst Center — device inventory, client monitoring, site management, and troubleshooting
- **Calculate** IPv4 and IPv6 subnets — VLSM planning, wildcard masks, allocation standards
- **Alert** via Slack — severity-formatted notifications, incident workflows, and user-aware routing
- **Diagram** your network with Draw.io topology maps (color-coded by reconciliation status)
- **Visualize** protocol hierarchies as interactive Markmap mind maps
- **Generate** UML and infrastructure diagrams via Kroki — 27+ types including network topology (nwdiag), rack layouts (rackdiag), packet headers (packetdiag), protocol state machines, sequence diagrams, C4 architecture, Mermaid, D2, Graphviz, ERD — output as SVG, PNG, PDF
- **Reference** IETF RFCs and Wikipedia for standards-compliant configuration
- **Store** reports, config backups, and diagrams on SharePoint via Microsoft Graph
- **Generate** Visio topology diagrams from CDP/LLDP discovery and upload to SharePoint
- **Notify** via Microsoft Teams — health alerts, change updates, and report delivery to Teams channels
- **Analyze** packet captures — upload a pcap to Slack and NetClaw runs deep tshark analysis: protocol hierarchy, conversations, endpoints, DNS/HTTP extraction, expert info, and filtered inspection
- **Track** network changes in GitHub — create issues from findings, commit config backups, open PRs for changes, link to ServiceNow CRs
- **Orchestrate** network services via Cisco NSO — retrieve device configs from NSO's CDB, check sync status, inspect operational state, discover service types and deployed instances, platform inventory, and NED management — all via RESTCONF from Slack
- **Simulate** network topologies in Cisco CML — create labs, add nodes, wire links, start/stop labs, execute CLI commands, capture packets on lab links, and manage CML users — all from natural language via Slack
- **Deploy** containerized network labs via ContainerLab — deploy multi-vendor topologies (SR Linux, cEOS, IOS XR, NX-OS, FRR, cRPD), inspect running labs, execute commands on nodes, and destroy labs when done — all through the ContainerLab API
- **Inspect** AWS cloud networking — VPCs, Transit Gateways, Cloud WAN, VPN tunnels, Network Firewalls, flow logs, ENI details, and route tables via 27 read-only AWS Network tools
- **Monitor** AWS CloudWatch — query metrics (VPN tunnel state, NAT GW drops, TGW traffic), check alarms, run Logs Insights queries, analyze VPC flow logs
- **Audit** AWS security — IAM users/roles/policies (read-only), CloudTrail API event history, credential rotation compliance, MFA enforcement
- **Analyze** AWS costs — service breakdowns, network cost drivers (NAT GW, TGW, VPN, data transfer), monthly trends, forecasts, anomaly investigation
- **Diagram** AWS architecture — auto-discover and render VPCs, subnets, TGWs, load balancers as visual topology diagrams (requires graphviz)
- **Audit** every action in an immutable Git-based trail (GAIT) — there is always an answer to "what did the AI do and why"

## OpenClaw Workspace Files

NetClaw ships with the full set of OpenClaw workspace markdown files. These are injected into the agent's system prompt at session start to define its identity, behavior, and operating procedures.

| File | Purpose | Loaded When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **[SOUL.md](SOUL.md)** | Core personality, CCIE expertise, 12 non-negotiable rules, protocol knowledge base | Every session |
| **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** | Operating instructions: memory system, safety rules, change management workflow, Slack behavior, escalation matrix | Every session |
| **[IDENTITY.md](IDENTITY.md)** | Name, creature type, vibe, emoji — NetClaw's identity card | Every session |
| **[USER.md](USER.md)** | Your preferences, timezone, role, network details — personalization layer (edit this) | Every session |
| **[TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)** | Local infrastructure notes: device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels, site info (edit this) | Every session |
| **[HEARTBEAT.md](HEARTBEAT.md)** | Periodic health checks: device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog scan | Every heartbeat cycle |

**How they work:** OpenClaw reads these files at session start and injects them under "Project Context" in the system prompt. Each file is capped at 20,000 characters. Sub-agents only receive AGENTS.md and TOOLS.md.

**What to customize:** Edit `USER.md` with your name, timezone, and preferences. Edit `TOOLS.md` with your device IPs, Slack channels, and site information. The rest define NetClaw's behavior and expertise — modify only if you want to change how the agent operates.

### AWS

**6 MCP servers, 5 skills** — networking, monitoring, security, cost, and architecture visualization.

#### Credentials

You need an IAM user with programmatic access. Three values:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `aws-network-ops` | List VPCs, inspect subnets/route tables/NACLs, Transit Gateway routes/attachments/peering, Cloud WAN, VPN tunnel status, Network Firewall rules, flow logs, ENI lookup, IP search |
| `aws-cloud-monitoring` | CloudWatch metrics (VPN tunnel state, NAT GW drops, TGW traffic, ELB health), alarms, Logs Insights queries, VPC/TGW flow log analysis |
| `aws-security-audit` | IAM users/roles/policies (read-only), MFA compliance, access key rotation, CloudTrail API event history, incident investigation |
| `aws-cost-ops` | Spending by service/region/tag, monthly trends, forecasts, anomaly detection, network cost drivers (NAT GW $0.045/GB, TGW $0.02/GB) |
| `aws-architecture-diagram` | Auto-discover infrastructure, render VPC/subnet/TGW topology as PNG/SVG/PDF (requires `graphviz`) |

#### Prerequisites

- AWS account with IAM user (programmatic access)
- `graphviz` for architecture diagrams: `apt install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`
- `uv` (installed automatically by `install.sh`) for running AWS MCP servers via `uvx`

#### Cost Notes

- **Cost Explorer API**: $0.01 per API request — NetClaw batches queries but be mindful of frequent polling
- **CloudWatch Logs Insights**: Charged per GB scanned — use narrow time ranges
- **All other operations**: Standard AWS API calls (no additional charge beyond normal AWS usage)

### GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

**4 remote MCP servers, 3 skills** — compute, monitoring, and logging.

#### Key Difference: Remote HTTP Servers

Google Cloud MCP servers are **remote HTTP endpoints hosted by Google** — nothing to install locally. They use Streamable HTTP transport and authenticate via OAuth 2.0 / Google IAM, not API keys.

| MCP Server | Endpoint | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Compute Engine | `https://compute.googleapis.com/mcp` | 28 tools — VMs, disks, templates, instance groups, snapshots, reservations |
| Cloud Monitoring | `https://monitoring.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — time series metrics, alert policies, active alerts, metric discovery |
| Cloud Logging | `https://logging.googleapis.com/mcp` | 6 tools — log search, VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs, buckets |
| Resource Manager | `https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/mcp` | 1 tool — project discovery (prerequisite for other servers) |

#### Credentials

You need a Google Cloud project and either a service account or user credentials:

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | `my-project-123` | Your Google Cloud project ID |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | `/path/to/key.json` | Path to service account key JSON file |

Or use `gcloud` CLI for user-based auth: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for project ID and optional service account key path.

#### IAM Roles (Minimum Permissions)

Grant these roles to your service account or user:

| Role | What It Grants |
|------|---------------|
| `roles/compute.viewer` | Read-only access to all Compute Engine resources |
| `roles/monitoring.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Monitoring metrics and alerts |
| `roles/logging.viewer` | Read-only access to Cloud Logging log entries |
| `roles/resourcemanager.projectViewer` | Read-only access to project metadata |

For write operations (create/delete VMs via Compute Engine MCP), add `roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1` — but use ServiceNow CR gating for any changes.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `gcp-compute-ops` | List/create/start/stop/delete VMs, inspect disks and templates, manage instance groups, discover machine types and images, check reservations and commitments |
| `gcp-cloud-monitoring` | Query time series metrics (CPU, network, disk), list alert policies and active violations, discover available metric types |
| `gcp-cloud-logging` | Search log entries (VPC flow logs, firewall logs, audit logs), discover available logs, inspect log buckets and views |

#### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with APIs enabled (Compute Engine, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging)
- Service account key JSON file, or `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated
- No local install required — servers are hosted by Google

#### Cost Notes

- **Cloud Logging**: Charged per GB scanned beyond 50 GB/month free tier
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Free for GCP metrics; custom metrics charged per time series
- **Compute Engine API calls**: No additional charge

#### Networking Gap

GCP's MCP servers currently cover Compute Engine (VMs) but **not the VPC fabric** — there are no MCP tools for VPC subnets, firewall rules, Cloud VPN, Cloud Interconnect, or Cloud Router. Google is adding more MCP servers regularly, so VPC-specific tools may arrive soon.

### Cisco ThousandEyes

**2 MCP servers, 2 skills** — network monitoring and deep path analysis.

#### Key Difference: Two Complementary MCP Servers

ThousandEyes uses **two MCP servers** that share a single API token:

| MCP Server | Transport | Tools | Strength |
|---|---|---|---|
| Community (`thousandeyes-mcp-community`) | stdio (Python, local) | 9 read-only tools | Core monitoring: tests, agents, path vis, dashboards |
| Official (`api.thousandeyes.com/mcp`) | Remote HTTP (Cisco-hosted) | ~20 tools | Advanced: alerts, outages, BGP, instant tests, endpoint agents, AI |

The community server runs locally via stdio. The official server is a remote HTTP endpoint hosted by Cisco — no local install, accessed via `npx mcp-remote` with Bearer token authentication.

#### Credentials

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TE_TOKEN` | `eyJhbGci...` | ThousandEyes API v7 OAuth bearer token (used by both servers) |

Get your token from: **ThousandEyes > Account Settings > Users & Roles > OAuth Bearer Token**

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` — the wizard prompts for the token.

#### What You Can Do

| Skill | Capabilities |
|-------|-------------|
| `te-network-monitoring` | List tests/agents, query test results, path visualization, dashboard widgets, alerts, events, outages, endpoint agents, anomalies, AI views explanations |
| `te-path-analysis` | Hop-by-hop path analysis (latency, loss, MPLS per hop), BGP route analysis (AS paths, prefix reachability from 300+ global monitors), outage investigation, instant on-demand tests, endpoint VPN diagnostics, BGP hijack/leak detection |

#### Prerequisites

- Cisco ThousandEyes account with API v7 access
- Python 3.12+ (for community MCP server)
- Node.js / npx (for official MCP server via `mcp-remote`)
- Org must not be opted out of ThousandEyes AI features (for official server)

#### Cost Notes

- **Community server tools**: Read-only, no additional cost beyond normal API usage
- **Instant Tests** (official server): Consume ThousandEyes test units — use judiciously
- **API rate limits**: Queries count against your org's ThousandEyes API rate limit

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions. OpenClaw loads them into the agent context at session start.

```markdown
---
name: pyats-health-check
description: "Comprehensive device health monitoring..."
user-invocable: true
metadata:
  { "openclaw": { "requires": { "bins": ["python3"], "env": ["PYATS_TESTBED_PATH"] } } }
---

# Device Health Check

(Step-by-step procedures, show command examples, threshold tables,
 report templates — everything the agent needs to work autonomously)
```

The `metadata.openclaw.requires` block declares binary and environment variable dependencies. The markdown body is the agent's playbook.

Every tool call goes through `scripts/mcp-call.py`, which handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate. No persistent server connections, no port management.

```
python3 mcp-call.py "<server-command>" <tool-name> '<arguments-json>'
```

## Safety

NetClaw enforces non-negotiable constraints at every layer:

**Never guesses device state** — runs a show command or queries NetBox first, always.

**Never touches a device without a baseline** — pre-change state is captured and committed to GAIT before any config push.

**Never skips the Change Request** — ServiceNow CR must exist and be in `Approved` state before execution (except Emergency changes, which require immediate human notification).

**Never runs destructive commands** — `write erase`, `erase`, `reload`, `delete`, `format` are refused at the MCP server level.

**Never auto-quarantines an endpoint** — ISE endpoint group modification always requires explicit human confirmation.

**NetBox is read-write** — NetClaw has full API access to create and update devices, IPs, interfaces, VLANs, and cables in NetBox.

**Always verifies after changes** — if post-change verification fails, the CR is not closed and the human is notified.

**Always commits to GAIT** — every session ends with `gait_log` so the human can see the full audit trail.

---

## GAIT Audit Trail

Every NetClaw session produces an immutable Git-based record of:
- What was asked
- What data was collected (and from where)
- What was analyzed (and what conclusions were reached)
- What was changed (and on what device)
- What the verification result was
- What ServiceNow tickets were created or updated

This is not optional. It is how NetClaw earns trust in production environments.

### What Goes Where

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent system prompt. Defines personality, CCIE expertise, rules, and workflow orchestration |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating instructions. Memory system, safety rules, change management, Slack behavior, escalation |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent identity card. Name, creature type, vibe, emoji |
| `USER.md` | About you. Preferences, timezone, role, network details. **Edit this.** |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local infrastructure. Device IPs, SSH hosts, Slack channels. **Edit this.** |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic checks. Device reachability, OSPF/BGP state, CPU/memory, syslog. |
| `workspace/skills/` | Skill source files. `install.sh` copies these to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` |
| `testbed/testbed.yaml` | pyATS device inventory. Referenced by `PYATS_TESTBED_PATH` env var |
| `config/openclaw.json` | Model config template. Sets primary/fallback model only — no MCP config |
| `mcp-servers/` | Tool backends cloned by `install.sh`. Gitignored — rebuilt on install |
| `scripts/mcp-call.py` | Handles MCP JSON-RPC protocol: initialize, notify, tool call, terminate |
| `scripts/gait-stdio.py` | Wraps GAIT MCP server for stdio mode (default is SSE) |

## Testbed Configuration

Edit `testbed/testbed.yaml` to define your network devices:

```yaml
devices:
  R1:
    alias: "Core Router"
    type: router
    os: iosxe
    platform: CSR1kv
    credentials:
      default:
        username: admin
        password: "%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}"
    connections:
      cli:
        protocol: ssh
        ip: your-device-hostname-or-ip
        port: 22
```

The `%ENV{NETCLAW_PASSWORD}` syntax pulls credentials from environment variables so they stay out of version control.
