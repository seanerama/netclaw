# TOOLS.md — Local Infrastructure Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the environment details that are unique to your deployment.

## Network Devices

Devices are defined in `testbed/testbed.yaml`. Update that file with your SSH-accessible Cisco devices.

```
### Example Device Map
- R1 → 10.1.1.1, Core Router, IOS-XE 17.9
- R2 → 10.1.1.2, Distribution Router, IOS-XE 17.9
- SW1 → 10.1.2.1, Access Switch, IOS-XE 17.9
- SW2 → 10.1.2.2, Access Switch, IOS-XE 17.9
```

## Platform Credentials

All credentials are in `~/.openclaw/.env`. Never put credentials in skill files or this document.

- This file is yours. Skills are shared. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes.
