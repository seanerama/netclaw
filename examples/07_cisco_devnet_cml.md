Hey, can you set up the following lab network for me?

*Topology:*
• R1 eth0/1 ↔ R2 eth0/1 (WAN)
• R1 eth0/0 ↔ SW1 eth0/2 (trunk)
• SW1: PC1 on eth0/0, PC2 on eth0/1
• R2 eth0/0 ↔ SW2 eth0/2 (trunk)
• SW2: Server1 on eth0/0, Server2 on eth0/1

*Requirements:*
• 10.10.20.170 is reserved for management — do not use
• VLANs: 10 (PC1), 30 (PC2), 40 (Server1), 50 (Server2)
• Router-on-a-Stick on R1 and R2
• OSPFv2 Area 0, /31 point-to-point links, passive interfaces on all LAN sub-interfaces
• Full RFC standards, best practices on all trunk and access ports

*When done please:*
1. Run a full set of pings and traceroutes across all VLANs and confirm 0% loss
2. Generate a draw.io topology diagram
3. Generate a Nana Banana topology file
4. Document the final IP plan and device configs

Let me know if you need any clarification before starting! 🙏
